# A600ROM
Flash ROM Kickstart replacement for the Amiga A600

## This project is in development and currently untested.

This project replaces the Kickstart ROM in the Amiga A600 with a 2M x 16 Flash chip. This allows 4 x 512kB or 2 x 1MB Flash banks.

Initial programming of the first Kickstart must be done with a programmer. But after that, programming can be done in-circuit from the Amiga.
